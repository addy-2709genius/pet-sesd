# Pet Medical Records Manager (Backend)

## Overview
The **Pet Medical Records Manager** is a backend CRUD application built using **Express.js** and **TypeScript** as part of the **SESD Workshop Assignment**. The system is designed to manage and organize medical records for multiple pets in a structured and efficient manner. It helps in tracking veterinary visits, vaccinations, medications, allergies, and routine health checkups through well-defined API endpoints.

---

##  Purpose of the System
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- Backend development using Express and TypeScript
- Proper implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts
- Clean **system design and architecture**
- CRUD operations without using any database

This project focuses on **code structure, design patterns, and logic**, rather than frontend or database integration.

## Features
-  Manage medical records for multiple pets
- Track vet visits, vaccinations, medications, and allergies
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Filter records by pet, treatment type, and date range
- Reminder support for upcoming vaccinations and checkups
- In-memory data storage (no database)
- RESTful API design

---

## OOP Concepts Used
The system is built using core Object-Oriented Programming principles:

- **Encapsulation** 
  Private properties are used inside classes to protect data.

- **Inheritance** 
  Common properties are inherited from a shared base model.

- **Abstraction** 
  Repository interfaces are used to define contracts.

- **Polymorphism** 
  Different repository implementations follow the same interface.

## System Architecture
The backend follows a clean layered architecture:
